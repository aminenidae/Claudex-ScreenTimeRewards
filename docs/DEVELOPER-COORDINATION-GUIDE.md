- Critical discovery (per-app points system required)
- 8 questions that still need answers

**What You'll Learn**:
- What the user wants
- What's still unclear (per-app points questions)

---

## 🚫 What NOT to Work On

### ❌ PIN Setup UI Fix
**File**: `apps/ParentiOS/Views/PINSetupView.swift`

**Problem**: Continue button not visible despite 3 fix attempts.

**Why Not**:
- Failed multiple times (spacing reduction, element sizing, ScrollView)
- Likely needs testing on actual device (not simulator)
- Deferred until architecture is stable

**If You Want to Fix It**:
- Read `docs/code-changes-2025-10-11.md` lines 170-315
- Test on REAL device (not simulator)
- Try GeometryReader or navigation bar button approach

---

### ❌ Duplicate Children Cleanup
**File**: `apps/ParentiOS/ViewModels/ChildrenManager.swift` (lines 205-289)

**Problem**: De-duplication by name doesn't work, cleanup feature doesn't delete from CloudKit.

**Why Not**:
- User already manually cleaned CloudKit
- De-duplication logic flawed (uses name instead of ChildID)
- Feature may not be needed anymore

**If You Want to Fix It**:
- Read `docs/code-changes-2025-10-11.md` lines 123-217
- Change de-duplication to use ChildID instead of name
- Test CloudKit deletion actually works

---

### ❌ Per-App Points System
**Files**: Multiple (PointsLedger, PointsEngine, Redemption UI, etc.)

**Problem**: Major refactor required, but design unclear.

**Why Not**:
- Awaiting user answers to 8 design questions (see `docs/architecture-confirmed-2025-10-11.md` lines 225-269)
- 2-3 day effort
- Blocks on clarification

**If User Answers Questions**:
- See `docs/implementation-plan-2025-10-11-final.md` Phase 3 section
- Will need full data model refactor

---

## ✅ What TO Work On

### Priority 1: Verify Device Role Detection + Mode Selection

**Effort**: 2-3 hours (QA + follow-up fixes)
**Status**: Code landed locally; awaiting simulator/device validation
**Reference**: `docs/implementation-plan-2025-10-11-final.md` (Phase 1 now marked as implemented)

**What to Test**:
- Child device first launch → DeviceRoleSetupView → select child → confirm ModeSelection shows both modes
- Parent device first launch → DeviceRoleSetupView → register as parent → verify Child Mode hidden & info card displayed
- Parent Mode access → PIN setup/entry triggered before navigation; check `pinManager.lock()` resets on exit
- Deep link (`claudex://pair/<code>`) on parent device → ensure navigation does **not** force Child Mode
- Build the ParentiOS target in Xcode (CLI `xcodebuild` is blocked in this sandbox because CoreSimulator cannot start)
- Child-device flow should automatically fetch CloudKit children when none are cached locally, and surface the selector once records arrive (no manual retry necessary)

**Follow-ups if issues surface**:
1. Double-check `DevicePairingPayload` syncing via `SyncService` (CloudKit logs in console)
2. Confirm `deviceRoleManager.isRoleSet` persists across relaunch via `UserDefaults`
3. Update documentation/test log with QA results

---

### Priority 2: Per-App Polish & Category Coverage

**Effort**: ~1–1.5 days (UI polish + category mapping)
**Status**: 🟡 Core flows complete; friendly metadata and category-only support pending
**Reference**: `docs/implementation-plan-2025-10-11-final.md` Phase 3, `docs/architecture-confirmed-2025-10-11.md`

**Next actions**:
1. Map learning/reward **categories** to concrete app identifiers (inventory-driven) so category-only setups populate per-app metrics; explicit app selections already appear instantly, and the new sync button covers friendly names.
2. Expose the new per-app balances + reward costs in Child Mode (grid + redemption flow) and add integration tests for DeviceActivity → ledger → redemption.
3. Polish the inventory sync UX (success toast, scheduled refresh) and surface icons on the parent dashboard.

**Testing**:
- Manual: verify a category-only configuration on device now yields populated app rows once mapping lands; confirm edits persist after relaunch.
- Unit/Integration: extend coverage for `PerAppConfigurationStore` persistence + `RedemptionService` multi-app deductions (new tests added; keep expanding once simulator permissions allow).

---

## 🔧 Current Codebase State

### Build Status
- ✅ **Compiles**: Yes (latest Xcode build + manual QA confirmed during Phase 2 roll-out)
- ⚠️ **Open Issues**: PIN setup Continue button still clipped on smaller devices; duplicate-child cleanup remains unreliable.
- ⚠️ **Warnings**: Clean up unused `result` in `SyncService` + redundant `await` warnings when time permits.

### Tracking Notes
- Device role flow, Level 1 dashboard, and the new Level 2 editors are merged locally; keep running QA on real devices after each change.
- DeviceActivity now tags sessions with `AppIdentifier`s—verify Screen Time entitlements on test devices to ensure per-app accrual fires in the wild.
- CloudKit schema updates (DevicePairing + upcoming per-app config records) were drafted—double-check in production container before shipping.

## 🚨 Critical Notes

### Apple's ApplicationToken Limitation (From Pivot)
- Tokens are device-specific and opaque
- Parent device tokens ≠ Child device tokens
- Configuration MUST happen on child device (where tokens are valid)
- This is why we're moving Parent Mode to child device

### Device Role Detection (Being Implemented)
- Uses CloudKit pairing records (our own system)
- NOT using Apple's native APIs (they don't provide this)
- No conflict with ApplicationToken limitation
- Allows hiding Child Mode on parent devices

### Per-App Points System (Pending)
- User clarified: Points tracked PER APP (not global)
- Each learning app has its own points balance
- Redemption is per-app (partial or full)
- MAJOR refactor required (2-3 days)
- Awaiting design clarification

---

## 💬 Communication Protocol

### User's Concerns
- **Time Wasted**: User frustrated with 3 failed PIN UI attempts
- **Manual Fixes**: User had to manually clean CloudKit (cleanup didn't work)
- **Coordination**: User wants proper documentation for team coordination

### What User Expects
- ✅ Documentation before coding (done)
- ✅ Clear action plan (done)
- ✅ No more wasted attempts (stop, document, plan, then execute)
- ✅ Progress tracking (update PRD, checklists, progress-log)

### How to Proceed
1. **Read documentation first** (don't jump into coding)
2. **Ask questions** if architecture is unclear
3. **Update progress log** as you work
4. **Commit frequently** with clear messages
5. **Test on real devices** (not just simulator)
