# Child Mode Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the child mode functionality for the Claudex Screen Time Rewards app.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Live Data Display
- Points balance from PointsLedger
- Today's points accrual
- Active reward time window with live countdown
- Recent activity history (last 5 ledger entries)

### 2. Redemption Request
- Simple "Request More Time" button
- Points selection interface (30-600 points)
- Live time preview (10 points = 1 minute default ratio)
- Validation for minimum/maximum amounts and balance sufficiency

### 3. Unlink Functionality
- Moved to secondary area (navigation bar trailing item)
- Confirmation alert to prevent accidental unlinking
- Clear visual separation from primary child-focused content

## Technical Implementation

### Data Integration
The ChildModeHomeView is wired to the existing ChildrenManager to access shared services:
- PointsLedger for balance and transaction data
- ExemptionManager for active reward time windows
- RedemptionService for point redemption functionality

### Live Updates
- Computed properties access ledger data directly
- Views automatically update when ledger data changes
- No additional binding needed due to PointsLedger's ObservableObject conformance

## Files Modified/Added

1. `apps/ParentiOS/Views/ChildModeHomeView.swift` - Main child mode interface
2. `apps/ParentiOS/Views/ChildRedemptionView.swift` - Redemption request interface
3. `apps/ParentiOS/ClaudexApp.swift` - Integration with app structure
4. `apps/ParentiOS/ViewModels/ChildrenManager.swift` - Data provider integration

## Validation
- Child mode displays correct points balance from PointsLedger
- Active reward time window shows live countdown
- Redemption request flow works with proper validation
- Unlink functionality properly removes device pairing
- UI adapts to different states (paired vs unpaired)

## Next Steps
1. Implement actual redemption processing (parent approval flow)
2. Add local notifications for time expiring alerts
3. Enhance child mode with additional educational content
4. Implement background task for accurate countdown when app is backgrounded
