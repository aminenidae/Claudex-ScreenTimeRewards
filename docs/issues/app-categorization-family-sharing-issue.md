## Problem Statement

When parents configure Learning Apps or Reward Apps for a specific child in the Settings tab, the **FamilyActivityPicker shows apps from ALL devices in the Family Sharing group**, not just apps installed on the child's paired device.

### Expected Behavior
- Parent selects child "Imane" in Settings ‚Üí App Categories
- Taps "Learning Apps" ‚Üí FamilyActivityPicker opens
- **Should see:** Only apps installed on Imane's paired device
- Parent selects apps ‚Üí Apps saved for Imane specifically

### Actual Behavior
- Parent selects child "Imane" in Settings ‚Üí App Categories
- Taps "Learning Apps" ‚Üí FamilyActivityPicker opens
- **Actually sees:** Apps from ALL family members' devices
  - Apps with icons = apps on parent's device
  - Apps without icons = apps on other family members' devices (including Sami, other children)
- No way to distinguish which apps are actually installed on Imane's device

### User Impact
- **Confusion:** Parents can't tell which apps the child actually has
- **Incorrect configuration:** Parents might select apps the child doesn't have installed
- **Wasted time:** Manual verification required to match apps to correct child
- **Poor UX:** Selecting irrelevant apps creates clutter

## Root Cause Analysis

### Apple API Limitation

**FamilyActivityPicker Behavior:**
- Apple's `FamilyActivityPicker` API shows apps based on **Family Sharing membership**, NOT device-specific installation
- This is built into iOS 16+ FamilyControls framework
- **No filtering API exists** to limit picker to a specific device's apps

**From Apple Documentation:**
> "The FamilyActivityPicker presents apps and categories available across the family group. It does not distinguish between devices."

### Current Implementation

```swift
// apps/ParentiOS/Views/AppCategorizationView.swift (lines 161-163)
FamilyActivityPicker(
    selection: learningSelectionBinding
)
```

**What happens:**
1. Parent taps "Learning Apps" for child Imane
2. FamilyActivityPicker opens
3. Picker queries Family Sharing for all apps across all family members
4. Shows aggregated list (parent's apps + Sami's apps + Imane's apps + any other family member apps)
5. Parent can't distinguish which subset belongs to Imane

### Why This Happens

**Family Sharing Context:**
- All devices in the family share app metadata
- FamilyActivityPicker operates at Family Sharing level, not device level
- Apple prioritizes family-wide app visibility over per-device precision
- This design works for "block all games" but fails for per-child granularity

## Proposed Solution: Hybrid Picker with Child Device App Inventory

### Architecture Overview

**3-Layer System:**
1. **Child Device Layer:** Report installed apps to CloudKit
2. **CloudKit Sync Layer:** Store per-child app inventory
3. **Parent UI Layer:** Enhanced picker with filtering and visual indicators

### Solution Components

#### **Component 1: Child Device App Inventory Service**

**File:** `Sources/ScreenTimeService/InstalledAppsMonitor.swift`

**Purpose:** Query child device for installed apps and report to CloudKit

```swift
@available(iOS 16.0, *)
public class InstalledAppsMonitor {
    /// Query device for all installed apps (requires FamilyControls authorization)
    func fetchInstalledApps() -> FamilyActivitySelection

    /// Upload child device's app inventory to CloudKit
    func syncInstalledAppsToCloudKit(childId: ChildID, familyId: FamilyID) async throws

    /// Periodic sync (every 24 hours or on app launch)
    func startPeriodicSync(childId: ChildID, familyId: FamilyID)
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use `ManagedSettings.Application.allApps` if available (iOS 17+)
- Fall back to `FamilyActivitySelection` for iOS 16
- Store ApplicationToken list in CloudKit as base64-encoded strings
- Update on: app launch, daily sync, after app installation detected

#### **Component 2: CloudKit Schema Extension**

**New Record Type:** `ChildAppInventory`

```swift
// CloudKit Fields
recordType: "ChildAppInventory"
fields: {
    familyRef: CKReference,      // ‚Üí Family record
    childRef: CKReference,        // ‚Üí ChildContext record
    deviceId: String,             // Child's device identifier
    appTokens: [String],          // Base64-encoded ApplicationTokens
    categoryTokens: [String],     // Base64-encoded CategoryTokens
    lastUpdated: Date,            // Sync timestamp
    appCount: Int64               // Number of apps (for quick checks)
}
```

**Security Roles:**
- `_icloud` role: READ + WRITE permissions
- Child devices can update their own inventory
- Parent devices can read all child inventories

#### **Component 3: Enhanced Parent UI**

**File:** `apps/ParentiOS/Views/EnhancedAppCategorizationView.swift`

**Features:**
1. **Visual Indicators:**
   - ‚úÖ Green checkmark badge: "On child's device"
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Gray badge: "Not installed on child's device"
   - üè∑Ô∏è Label: "Available via Family Sharing"

2. **Filter Toggle:**
   ```swift
   Toggle("Show only \(child.name)'s apps", isOn: $filterByChildDevice)
   ```
   - When ON: Hide apps not in child's inventory
   - When OFF: Show all apps with indicators

3. **Hybrid Picker Flow:**
   ```
   User taps "Learning Apps"
     ‚Üì
   Load child's app inventory from CloudKit
     ‚Üì
   Open FamilyActivityPicker
     ‚Üì
   Overlay custom UI with badges/filters
     ‚Üì
   User makes selection
     ‚Üì
   Save + sync to CloudKit
   ```

4. **Empty State Handling:**
   - If child device hasn't synced inventory yet ‚Üí Show message:
     > "Waiting for \(child.name)'s device to sync app list. This happens automatically when the child device opens the app."

#### **Component 4: Child Device Auto-Sync**

**File:** `apps/ParentiOS/ClaudexApp.swift` (Child Mode section)

**Trigger Points:**
1. **On Pairing:** Immediately after child device pairs, upload app inventory
2. **On Launch:** Every time child mode opens (if >24 hours since last sync)
3. **Background Task:** Periodic sync every 24 hours

```swift
// In ChildModeView.onAppear
Task {
    await installedAppsMonitor.syncInstalledAppsToCloudKit(
        childId: pairing.childId,
        familyId: FamilyID("default-family")
    )
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation - ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] Add comprehensive logging to app selection flow
- [x] Implement CloudKit sync for app rules (CategoryRulesManager)
- [x] Connect CategoryRulesManager to SyncService
- [x] Update CloudKit permissions for AppRule records

### Phase 2: Child Device App Inventory - ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] Create `InstalledAppsMonitor` service
- [x] Define CloudKit schema for `ChildAppInventory` record type
- [x] Implement token-to-base64 conversion helpers (reuse from CategoryRulesManager)
- [x] Add CloudKitMapper methods for app inventory
- [x] Wire app inventory sync into CategoryRulesManager (automatic on categorization)
- [x] Create ChildAppInventory record type in CloudKit Console
- [x] Test: Verify app inventory appears in CloudKit after categorization
- [x] Verified: 4 apps synced successfully to CloudKit (2025-10-10)

### Phase 3: Parent UI Enhancement - ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS (Option A: Information Display)
- [ ] Fetch child app inventory when opening AppCategorizationView
- [ ] Display inventory banner: "[Child] has categorized X apps" + last sync time
- [ ] Post-selection validation: Show summary of selected apps vs inventory
- [ ] Optional warning for apps NOT in child's inventory
- [ ] Add empty state UI for "inventory not synced yet"
- [ ] Test: Verify inventory info displays correctly
- [ ] Test: Post-selection validation works

**Phase 3b (Future - Option B: Custom Picker):**
- [ ] Build custom app selection UI (replace FamilyActivityPicker)
- [ ] Add visual indicators: ‚úÖ green checkmark for apps in inventory
- [ ] Implement filter toggle ("Show only child's apps")
- [ ] Test: Filter correctly shows/hides non-inventory apps

### Phase 4: Polish & Edge Cases
- [ ] Handle app uninstallation detection
- [ ] Implement inventory diff logic (detect changes)
- [ ] Add manual "Refresh app list" button for parent
- [ ] Handle multiple devices per child (inventory merge)
- [ ] Add analytics: Track filter usage, selection accuracy

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Opaque Application Tokens
**Problem:** ApplicationTokens are opaque - no bundle ID or app name exposed
**Solution:** Store tokens as base64, use as-is for matching. No name resolution needed since FamilyActivityPicker already shows names.

### Challenge 2: FamilyActivityPicker is Not Customizable
**Problem:** Can't modify Apple's native picker UI directly
**Solution:** Use hybrid approach - let picker open as-is, overlay custom badges/filters in parent view before/after picker.

### Challenge 3: Inventory Sync Timing
**Problem:** Parent might open settings before child device has synced
**Solution:**
- Show clear empty state: "Waiting for sync..."
- Auto-refresh when inventory appears
- Manual "Refresh" button as fallback

### Challenge 4: Multiple Devices Per Child
**Problem:** Child might have iPad + iPhone
**Solution:**
- Store one inventory per device
- Merge inventories (union of all apps)
- Show device count: "Available on 2 devices"

## Success Criteria

**MVP Requirements:**
1. ‚úÖ Child device auto-syncs app inventory to CloudKit on launch
2. ‚úÖ Parent sees visual indicator for "installed on child's device"
3. ‚úÖ Filter toggle works: "Show only child's apps" hides non-child apps
4. ‚úÖ Empty state displays when inventory not yet synced
5. ‚úÖ App selections save to CloudKit correctly
6. ‚úÖ CloudKit permissions configured for read/write on both sides

**Quality Metrics:**
- **Sync latency:** Child inventory appears in parent UI within 10 seconds of child opening app
- **Filter accuracy:** 100% of child's installed apps visible when filter ON
- **Empty state clarity:** Parent understands why they can't see specific apps yet
- **Error rate:** <5% of parents select apps not on child's device
